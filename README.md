# CP Calc
## Description
CP Calc is a browser-based web app designed to help Type I Diabetics who have completed the DAFNE training program to calculate the number of carbohydrate portions in their meals based on a nutrition label. It requires three inputs - the weight of the food, the carbohydrate weight within that food and the weighed-out portion size the patient intends to eat. 

Calculating carbohydrate portions accurately is an important part of calculating a diabetic's insulin dose prior to eating a meal. This web app aims to take manual calculations away from the patient and run the numbers for them, giving them the carbohydrate portions as taught in the course (i.e. to the nearest half portion.)

## More about DAFNE
DAFNE stands for Dose Adjustment For Normal Eating. It aims to help adults with type 1 diabetes lead as normal a life as possible, whilst also maintaining blood glucose levels within healthy targets, to reduce the risk of long-term diabetic complications. More information about the course can be found [here](https://dafne.nhs.uk/).

## What is a carbohydrate portion?
In any meal a type 1 diabetic eats, they will carb count in order to calculate their insulin dose. DAFNE teaches that a carbohydrate portion is 10 grams of carbohydrate in any food we eat. There are certain circumstances where you might not include every single carbohydrate listed on a nutrition label such as in nuts and legumes, but for most scenarios, a patient will want to know exactly how many carbohydrates are in their meal and use their best judgement to increase or reduce their insulin intake based on other factors as taught by DAFNE.
